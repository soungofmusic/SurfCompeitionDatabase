## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

The database is built around six main tables that organize the competitive surfing ecosystem:

*Entity Relationship Diagram showing table relationships*

### Tables Overview
- **Surfers**: Stores athlete information including rankings
- **Competitions**: Tracks events with locations and dates
- **Rounds**: Organizes competition phases
- **Heats**: Individual matchups within rounds
- **Heat_Scores**: Individual scoring for surfers in heats (M:M resolution)
- **Results**: Competition outcomes at various levels (M:M resolution)

## üîÑ Database Relationships

### One-to-Many Relationships

**Competition to Rounds**: One competition has many rounds
```sql
-- Query to get all rounds for a specific competition
SELECT r.round_id, r.round_type 
FROM Rounds r
JOIN Competitions c ON r.competition_id = c.competition_id
WHERE c.competition_name = 'Lexus Pipe Pro';
```

**Rounds to Heats**: One round has many heats
```sql
-- Query to get all heats in a specific round
SELECT h.heat_id, h.heat_number
FROM Heats h
JOIN Rounds r ON h.round_id = r.round_id
WHERE r.round_type = 'Semi-Final' AND r.competition_id = 1;
```

### Many-to-Many Relationships

**Surfers to Heats**: Many surfers participate in many heats, resolved through Heat_Scores
```sql
-- Query to get all surfers in a specific heat with their scores
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, hs.score_num
FROM Surfers s
JOIN Heat_Scores hs ON s.surfer_id = hs.surfer_id
JOIN Heats h ON hs.heat_id = h.heat_id
WHERE h.heat_number = 1 
AND h.round_id = (SELECT round_id FROM Rounds WHERE round_type = 'Knockout' LIMIT 1);
```

**Surfers to Competitions**: Many surfers participate in many competitions, resolved through Results
```sql
-- Query to find all competitions a surfer has participated in
SELECT c.competition_name, c.competition_location, r.placement
FROM Results r
JOIN Competitions c ON r.competition_id = c.competition_id
JOIN Surfers s ON r.surfer_id = s.surfer_id
WHERE s.first_name = 'Griffin' AND s.last_name = 'Colapinto';
```

## üìä Sample Data & Outputs

### Sample Surfers Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM Surfers LIMIT 5;
```

**Output:**
| surfer_id | first_name | last_name | origin_country | age | world_rank |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------------|-----|------------|
| 1         | Griffin    | Colapinto | United States  | 25  | 1          |
| 2         | Jack       | Robinson  | Australia      | 26  | 2          |
| 3         | John John  | Florence  | Hawaii         | 31  | 3          |
| 4         | Ethan      | Ewing     | Australia      | 25  | 4          |
| 5         | Jordy      | Smith     | South Africa   | 36  | 5          |

### Competition Results Query
```sql
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, r.placement 
FROM Results r
JOIN Surfers s ON r.surfer_id = s.surfer_id
WHERE r.competition_id = 1 AND r.result_type = 'Competition'
ORDER BY r.placement;
```

**Output:**
| first_name | last_name | placement |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Griffin    | Colapinto | 1         |
| Jack       | Robinson  | 2         |
| John John  | Florence  | 3         |

### Heat Scores Query
```sql
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, hs.score_num
FROM Heat_Scores hs
JOIN Surfers s ON hs.surfer_id = s.surfer_id
JOIN Heats h ON hs.heat_id = h.heat_id
WHERE h.heat_number = 1
ORDER BY hs.score_num DESC;
```

**Output:**
| first_name | last_name | score_num |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Griffin    | Colapinto | 19.95     |
| Jack       | Robinson  | 18.00     |
| John John  | Florence  | 15.22     |
